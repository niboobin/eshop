# Module 1


## Reflection 1

I think i have a lot to improve when 
writing my code. For example i could try  
using a more  descriptive and meaningful names for 
classes, methods, variables, and parameters to enhance 
readability and understanding of the code.
Maintain consistent formatting and indentation throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.

## Reflection 2

1. After writing unit tests, I feel more confident in the correctness and validity
of my code.Regarding the number of unit tests in a class, there isn't a strict rule, but it's generally advisable to have enough tests to cover various scenarios
, including normal cases, edge cases, and error cases.


2. while the new functional test suite follows the same structure as existing ones, there are opportunities to improve code cleanliness and maintainability by addressing potential issues such as code duplication, clarity of test cases, handling magic numbers/strings, error handling, and readability. By refactoring and applying these improvements, the code quality can be enhanced without reducing its effectiveness.
